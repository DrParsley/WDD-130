        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Elevator Pitch
            When is the last time you went to a museum? The world is driven by technology and online interactions and
            people tend to spend less time on adventures, and more exploring the internet. Places like museums, and art
            galleries are slowly adapting to this reality by taking their exhibits online. I aim to get lost treasures
            and history back into the public's eye by building a website that allows them to view and experience those
            treasures.
        </p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p> The audience who would be interested in this site are those who want to see tanks and various war vehicles from specific museums.
            It would aim to collect images and information about the local attractions and make them instantly available, this would allow a person to learn more about 
            these local attractions and even jump to similar items at another location with ease using helpful tags for each exabit. 
            The aim is to allow someone to find all the tanks nearby without needing to travel from place to place searching.

                Welcome to the Online tank museum. We have collected a variety of images and information about tanks at local museums in your area. 
            We hope to continue collecting exabits from various locations so that you are able to see what tanks are out there in the world. 
            We have a few tanks from various nations, most being from the Soviet Union, Germany, America, and Brittan. We hope you enjoy your time perusing our site!

            We have two somewhat modern tanks to view. The Soviet T-72, and the German Leopard 1. <br><br>
            The Leopard 1 was developed and entered service in 1965. The tank featured HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) chemical rounds designed to easily penetrate conventional heavy armor. With modern munitions, the use of heavy tanks began to wain as armor was less effective, and speed, mobility, and adaptive weapon systems became the new focus. The Leopard 1 was developed with the main goal of maneuverability with firepower as the second focus. 
            <br><br>The T-72 was developed by Russia and was put into service in 1973, and it still is in use up to this day. The T-72 was an improvement on the T-62, it sported a 125 mm smooth bore main gun, with a max speed of 37-47 mph. There were 25,000 units produced, and they are in use in over 40 different countries. The T-72 has many variations and modifications allowing each country to adapt the tank for their particular needs.

        <p>
            We have an old American tank and a more modern British tank to view. <br><br>
The American tank shown is the M4 Sherman, designed and adapted form the M3 medium tank. It served in 1942-1957 during WW2. The tank was not the best on the field, but it was cheap to produce, allowing the United States to flood the battlefield with sheer numbers. At first it sported a 75 mm gun, but later variations were known to sport a 76mm, or 105mm howitzer. It was more reliable than many opposing tanks, and required far less maintenance and upkeep allowing it to be very efficient when used in proper tank company tactics.
<br><br>The British Centurion was produced in 1945 and is considered one of the most successful post war tank designs. Some countries still use these tanks to this day. This tank features a 105mm rifled gun, and has a maximum speed of 22mph. This tank was designed with features similar to the British Comet, and Cromwell tanks.
