                <p id="text2">The Leopard 1 was developed and entered service in 1965. The tank featured HEAT (High Explosive Anti Tank) chemical rounds designed to easily penetrate conventional heavy armor. With modern munitions, the use of heavy tanks began to wain as armor was less effective, and speed, mobility, and adaptive weapon systems became the new focus. The Leopard 1 was developed with the main goal of maneuverability with firepower as the second focus.
