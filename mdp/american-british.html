                    The American tank shown is the M4 Sherman, designed and adapted form the M3 medium tank. It served in 1942-1957 during WW2. The tank was not the best on the field, but it was cheap to produce, allowing the United States to flood the battlefield with sheer numbers. At first it sported a 75 mm gun, but later variations were known to sport a 76mm, or 105mm howitzer. It was more reliable than many opposing tanks, and required far less maintenance and upkeep allowing it to be very efficient when used in proper tank company tactics.

                    The British Centurion was produced in 1945 and is considered one of the most successful post war tank designs. Some countries still use these tanks to this day. This tank features a 105mm rifled gun, and has a maximum speed of 22mph. This tank was designed with features similar to the British Comet, and Cromwell tanks.
