        <h3>A little about who I am.</h3>
        <p>
            I am working to be a IT administrator, and hope to learn as much as I can within the classes at BYUI so that I can be successful. I love computers and working on any electronics.  <br>
            I am engaged and super excited to marry Abbie, the love of my life and future eternal companion. We are getting married on June 11th. I tend to spend most of my spare time with her, and I couldnt be happier anywhere else. <br> 
            I love to listen to audiobooks, work on puzzles, watch movies, and enjoy the outdoors. A few random facts about me is that I love eating at wendys, and I love tanks. I have a large knowledge of tanks from WWI all the way up to modern tanks today. I can identify almost all by sight. Try me :)
            I am a huge animal lover and currently have a large collection of strange fish that I watch when I am stressed. They are super soothing to watch. 
            
            I have been a member of the church for my whole life, my favorite scriptures are in Mosiah, chapter 3 and 4.
